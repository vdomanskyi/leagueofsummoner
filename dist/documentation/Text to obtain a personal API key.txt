League of Summoner Widget


League of Summoner Widget:
League of Summoner is a user-friendly widget designed to display and analyze summoner statistics in real time, tailored specifically for streamers and players. The widget highlights key data points, including rank, tier, wins, losses, total matches, win rate, and match history.

This tool enhances live stream interactivity by providing viewers with detailed insights while also helping players monitor their performance. The data refreshes every N seconds, ensuring accurate and current information at all times.

The widget utilizes APIs such as match, summoner, and league-v4 to gather the necessary data. To ensure secure and efficient operation, all requests are routed through an AWS Lambda proxy server.

Weâ€™ve made setup simple by including clear instructions for StreamElements overlays, enabling easy integration for streamers without technical complications.

Lastly, League of Summoner prioritizes user data protection, ensuring sensitive details like the Riot API key remain secure and private.
